???: (They should be thanking me really, this trip would be incredibly boring without my intervention.)

???: (But now I just have to wait… For my plan to come into action…)

*Fades into the attendant area*

Lorelei: (My name is Lorelei Firani.)

Lorelei: (Day to day I am a normal flight attendant, carrying out my regular duties, but today is an exception. Where I must forget my responsibilities, and instead act selfishly).

(You see, "Florani" is simply my mother's maiden name. Had she married my father... I would be known as a *Baggins*.)

(I am, in fact, the sole daughter of Monty Baggins and rightful heir to his estate, unbeknownst to him, of course.)

(He only sees me as a mere piece of furniture, though, just like my mother. Something to use, stain, and throw away once you’ve found a replacement.)

(So, no, I’m not here for a family reunion, no way. Just looking at that bastard’s face and his bitch wife makes me want to vomit.)

~ Rose Guns Days - Traumatic ~

(Monty Baggins abandoned my mother 22 years ago, leaving her as a single mother to raise me.)

(To cope she gave into alcohol, and would often take her anger out on me. It was not the ideal childhood environment, to say the least.)

(At one point, it looked like things were going to be fine. But today... all I have of her is this pendant. I treasure it dearly.)

(I don’t blame her for anything that happened to us.)

(It’s my father, Monty Baggins', fault, for ruining her life.)

(Ever since I became old enough to fully understand the scum that my father is, I’ve had a rage in my heart, one that I couldn’t distract myself from.)

(So I decided on the only logical course of action to relieve my anxiety.)

(Kill Monty Baggins, and his wife. And get sweet retribution for what he did to me my mother.)

(I wish for nothing less than a perfect cr-

*music fade out*

Lilian: “Um. excuse me.”

Lorelei: “A-Ah yes? What is it?”

Lillian: “Can I have some peanuts?”

Lorelei: “Sure. You don’t have an allergy, do you?”

Lillian: "No allergy. Go ahead."

Lorelei: (Then I hope you choke on them.)

[Lorelei hands the peanuts to Lilian and switches places.]

Lorelei: (You see, I was already training to be a flight attendant. I’ve always wanted to travel, and so did my mother, but we could never afford to when I was younger.)

(It was the ideal set-up, all I’d have to do was climb up the ranks until I could be assigned to a private plane such as this. And I succeeded.)

(But then came the not-so-easy part.)

(I’d have to kill Monty and his wife somehow in a confined plane such as this… without arousing too much suspicion around myself...)

(I am here to fix my life, not ruin it further, after all.)

(So I came up with a plan…)
*Glass CG comes up*

(On the Soaring Siren it is customary for us to serve drinks to our passengers on every flight.)

(So I would take this opportunity to poison Monty and Lilians drinks.)

(But I wouldn’t poison the wine directly, that would be too obvious…)

(Instead, I would poison the rims of the glasses with a liquid poison in advance, and would mark the stems marker pen, to disguinish them from the others.)

(I’d get that other flight attendant, Riley to pour the drinks, to frame them.)

(Then after that, I would serve the passengers the drinks myself, ensuring that Monty and Lilian received the poisoned glasses…)

(It was a near-perfect plan… and I could even frame Riley further, by transferring the poison container to their pocket..)

(But when it actually came to the moment I poisoned the glasses, I was careless… I got caught…)

(However… what ensued after that fact… was something I could never have anticipated.)

*Now switch to Lorelei POV*

Lorelei: (I need to make sure these rims are coated in poison. I can’t take any half-measures.)

(If they survive… this will have all been for nothing-)

Danny: “Lorelei”

Lorelei: “WAHHH!”

Danny: “What are you doing?”

Lorelei: (Shit shit shit. What do I say? Need to come up with an excuse fast!)

Lorelei: “Uh, I’m just making sure the rims of these glasses are clean, you know last time we got some complaints about water damage…”

Danny: “You’re not trying to poison our esteemed guests, are you?”

Lorelei: “N-No! Of course not! Why would you even suggest such a-”

Danny: “Shhh. Keep your voice down. It’s alright.”

Lorelei: “?”

Danny: “Y’know it’s actually a pretty funny coincidence…
“Because I also plan to kill the people on this plane.”

“So how about we work together? I’ll keep your secret if you keep mine…”

Switch back to narrator Lorelei. 

(After that other flight attendant, Danny, confronted me… of course, I had no choice but to say yes.)

(So he agreed to help me with my plan to poison Monty and Lilian.)

(In exchange for me helping him with his plan, a sick murder mystery game of sorts.)

(But… by agreeing to work together with Danny, I wouldn’t just be them that would die, I would be condemning everyone on this plane… including myself.)

*Fade in and out to plane interior*

Camilla: “What do you mean there’s no Wi-Fi?!”
“My mother said she made sure-”

Riley: “I’m sorry ma’m, we arranged in-flight Wi-Fi for this trip but… it’s just not working.”

“We don’t know why.”

“And since we’re already in the air, there’s nothing we can do about it. I’m sorry.”

(Danny cut the Wi-Fi so that no one would be able to have any contact with the outside whilst we conducted our “murder mystery”.)

(I knew that it would upset one of the Baggins in particular.)

Camilla: “Useless!”

“So-called luxury flight and you can’t even get a basic thing like Wi-Fi right?”

“What are we even paying you for?!”

Riley: “I really am sorry, Ma’am.”

Camilla: “Ugh! I am actually going to die of boredom on this trip. I guess I’ll just play Soduku? Or something!”

Lilian: “Orrr you could actually talk to your family.”

Camilla: “....Soduku it is.”

Monty: “Well I don’t know about anyone else, my throat is getting rather dry from talking so much.”

Monty: “How about some drinks? You’re finally at legal drinking age, Camilla, might cheer you up a bit.”

Camilla: “...”

Goldeen: “Good idea, Monty.”

“In fact, I brought something special for this trip.”

“Red wine produced from the vineyards of Zheng Fa.”

“It has a very unique taste, on the sweeter side, I think you’ll like it, Camilla.”

Scion: “I’ve had this one before. It’s a taste sensation.”

Lilian: “Hmmm if you like it Fliss, i’ll just have to try it.”

Camilla: “Fine. I’ll have some as well.”

Riley: “If you give that bottle to me, ma’am, I can pour it into the special glassware we have on the Soaring Siren.”

Goldeen: “...”

Goldeen: “Yes alright, go ahead.”

Lorelei: (Hmm looks like I didn’t even need to ask Riley to pour the drinks. They’re just that eager.)

Goldeen: “Actually, how many glasses do you have? Enough for everyone?”

Riley: “We have enough for your entire family, we made sure especially.”

Goldeen: “No, I mean for you flight attendants as well.”

Riley: “Oh that’s very kind of you, ma’am, but we really shouldn’t be drinking on the job.”

Goldeen: “Nonsense this is a celebration, one glass won’t hurt, I insist.”

Monty: “Goldeen… when did you become so charitable?”

Goldeen: “What do you mean, Monty? I have always been one to share, even with the lower class.”

Monty: “Ha! This is the first I’m hearing of this. But are you sure there will be enough wine to go around? I don’t want you skimping on my glass…”

Goldeen: “Oh don’t worry. I came prepared, with multiple bottles of this stuff. No way I was going to stay sober this entire flight!”

Monty: “Very well then…”

Goldeen: "But no wine for you of course, Bentley."

"Maybe the flight attendants can pour you some cream soda."

Ben: "....Okay!" *Bentley is GAMING!"

Riley: "Coming right up!" *salute animation*

Lorelei: (Hmmm… This was unexpected. But it doesn’t matter. As long as I make sure that the poisoned glasses are still given to Lilain and Monty-)

Goldeen: “Theo, be a dear and serve the drinks, will you?”

Theo: “Of course, Ma’am.”

Lorelei: (No! This isn’t good! If the butler serves the drinks… then anyone here could be poisoned!)

Lorelei: (But if I say something, that will make me suspicious!)

Lorelei: (No… it can’t be helped… Just as long as it’s not me… or Danny… but Riley is also my scapegoat!)

Theo: "And your glass, ma’am."

Lorelei: "Oh! Thank you."

(I got lucky… no mark on my glass.)

(And Danny seems to be smiling… I assume he’s also safe.)

(But as for the rest… it’s too late now… the chessboard has already been set up, I just have to wait for the game to play out…)

Monty: “Cheers! To our long-awaited family reunion! And hopefully a wonderful trip to Zheng Fa!”

Lorelei: (Wonderful?… unfortunately not. Things are about to get ugly.)

*GLASS SHATTERING SFX AND TRANSITION*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

???: "Lorelei?"

Danny: "Lorelei?!"

"Are you alright?"

Lorelei: (Why is pretending to be concerned about my well being?… As if he isn’t the reason I’m going to die today.)

Lorelei: “Yes… I just felt quite light-headed for a moment there.”

Danny: “Hmmm strange. Me too. But it must just be the high altitude.”

Danny: “Or the excitement of this murder plot we have planned.”

Lorelei: “So, you didn’t get a poisoned glass either?”

Danny: “No, we were really lucky. This does put a slight pin in our plans, but we’re all going to die anyway right, so why does it matter?”

Lorelei: “…”

(This guy is psychotic. How can he smile like that knowing that he is going to be responsible for the deaths of {n} people.)

Danny: “Hopefully Riley didn’t get the poisoned glass either, I managed to slip your vial of poison into their pocket.”

“Should serve to frame them perfectly.”

“This plan is going to be so much more fun now that we’ve got this whole murder mystery set up.”

“I mean is there a better way to spend your last moments?”

Lorelei: (I can think of multiple.)

Danny: “How long did you say the poison would take to kick in?”

Lorelei: “Hmm my research said a few minutes… to hours, it really varies depending on the person.”

Danny: “I guess we have no choice but to wait in anticipation.”

Danny: “Wanna do something fun in the meantime?”

Lorelei: “Like what?”

Danny: “You know…”

Lorelei: “...”

Danny: “...”

Lorelei: “Gross! How can you think of something like that at a time like this!”

Danny: “C’mon, Laura. Won’t you grant this dying man one last wish?”

Lorelei: “I’m going to ignore you.”

Danny: “Fine… Fine... suit yourself.”

Lorelei: (Creep.)

*Fade in and out into plane interior*

Lilian: “…Hmmm, where is Monty?”

Scion: “In the bathroom I presume. An entire glass of wine? No way his bladder could even stand a chance.”

Lilian: “Ahahaha! You’re right.”

Lilian: “But he’s been in there for a while.”
“I should probably check that he hasn’t fallen in.”

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

Lilain: “Monty? Are you in there?”

……………………………………

Lilian: Monty, this is no time to play silly games.

……………………………………

Lilian: “M-Monty?”

Theo: “Ma’am? What the matter.”

Lilian: “Oh, Theo! It’s Monty. I don’t know where he is. I assumed he would be in the bathroom.”

“It is locked… But he’s not responding.”

Theo: “I see… Most peculiar.”

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

Theo: “Monty. It’s Theo. Are you alright?”

……………………………………………

Theo: “...”

Theo: “Don’t worry ma’am, I’ll get one of the flight attendants to open this door right away.”

*Fade in and out into flight attendants area*

Theo: “Um excuse me, Miss. Have you seen Monty anywhere?”

“He seems to be missing.”

Theo: “We assume he is in the bathroom… but he’s not responding.”

Lorelei: (Monty… did he really still get poisoned? I can’t believe it. How did I get so lucky…)

Lorelei: “Mr. Baggins? No, I haven’t seen him, I’m afraid.”

Goldeen: “What’s going on, Theo?”

Theo: “Monty… he’s missing, Ma’am.”

Goldeen: “Have you checked the bathroom?”

Theo: “Yes… it appears to be locked, but when I knocked there was no answer.”

Goldeen: “Did any of you flight attendants lock the bathroom door?”

Lorelei: “No… not that I am aware of.”

Theo: “Then he must be in there.”

Theo: “Please. I request that you open the bathroom door right away.”

Lorelei: “Very well…”

(This is it… the moment I’ve been waiting for for so long. I’m finally going to see Monty Baggins… dead.)

*Fade out*

*Black screen*

*Lock click*

*door opening*

*shrill scream*

*crime scene appears*

Lilain: “B-lood?”

“No I can’t look… I’m going to be… sick.”

Scion: “What’s going on? Lilian are you alright?”

“!”

Scion: “That can’t be Monty’s blood… can it?”

Goleen: “Of course it is! Who else’s could it be?”

Camilla: “What’s all the commotion about? Has something happened?”

Bentley: “Mum…?”

Goldeen: “Bentley! Camilla... please. Stay in your seats.”

“I don’t want you seeing this…”

Theo: “Ma’am please. You should return to your seat as well.”

It’s simply too gruesome.

Goldeen: “No… I’m staying here.”

Lorelei: (H-how could this happen? Did someone get to Monty before us? But who? And where the hell is his body?)

(Danny is white as a sheet… he didn’t know about this either.)

Riley: “Oh… Oh my God…”

Lorelei: (I should… try and make sense of this scene… Is there another killer on the plane? What could that even mean for me and Danny’s plans…)

*investigation scene*

Blood: (Ugh dammit. I stepped in blood… I need to wash this off.)

Goldeen: Why are you being so careless?! This is a crime scene.

Lorelei: Y-yes. Sorry Ma’am.

The player investigates the watch + knife + blood gets added to court record.

(Lorelei asks Theo and Goldeen about the watch and they explain it.)

(I think that’s everything for now.)

[After this part they start discussing the murder.]
